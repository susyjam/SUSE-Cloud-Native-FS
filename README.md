  1. How are you doing so far in this course and community in relation to your original motivation?
  In the course I am doing well, if I have had doubts I think I was able to solve them thanks to friends. I am learning a lot and I have a great time in this community
  2. Are you on track / what you expected and hoped for? If not, what can you do to get there?
  If I'm on the right track, it's what I expected. The course is a bit challenging but it is something I like as it motivates me to study more.
  3. What has helped you succeed and stay motivated / succeed thus far?
  What helped me is to keep a report of my activities in github together with #daily_scrum in addition to the constant motivation of many friends in this great community:purple_heart: a special mention to study groups #st_spanish #st_spaic :nerd_face:
